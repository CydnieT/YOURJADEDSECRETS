YJS Upgrade v29 — Phrase Request Inbox Fix (No Seek & Find Edition)

What this does:
- inner-chamber.html: "REQUEST PHRASE" now emails yourjadedsecrets@gmail.com (NOT cydniet@gmail.com)
- Adds a stronger intake email template (subject + body prompts)
- Adds a micro-boundary line under the buttons
- Keeps a simple device-local unlock (client-side) so the page still *feels* gated
- Includes a rooms.html fallback in case you don’t have the map page yet

How to use:
1) Unzip this
2) Upload/replace these files in your GitHub repo root (YourJadedSecrets):
   - inner-chamber.html
   - rooms.html (ONLY if you don’t already have one)
3) Commit changes
4) Refresh the live site

That’s it.
