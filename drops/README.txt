YJS Drops Folder

How to add a new drop:
1) Put the file in this /drops folder (PDF, ZIP, PNG, etc.)
2) Name it cleanly (no weird symbols). Example: priestess-prompts.pdf
3) Update the link in inner-altar.html to point to: drops/your-file-name

Note: GitHub Pages serves static files. If it's in the repo, it can be downloaded.
